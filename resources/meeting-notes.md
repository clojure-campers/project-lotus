# 9/25/2024
# We can begin keeping our meeting notes today:

-We made this repository so anyone can pull this and see our work.

-Our goal is to create a gui that runs scripts that 
generate project templates.

-Eventually perhaps a dependency manager.

-We may do this multiple ways just to learn and study
Clojure together.
